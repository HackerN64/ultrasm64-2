# Ultra Super Mario 64 2

This repository is a clean slate for basic enhancements built upon the *Super Mario 64* decompilation. It is a spritual successor to CrashOveride95's *UltraSM64*.

## Quick Start (for Ubuntu)

1. Install prerequisites: `sudo apt install -y binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential git pkgconf python3`
2. Clone the repo from within Linux: `git clone https://github.com/HackerN64/ultrasm64-2.git`
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the project folder for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `jp`, `us`, `eu`, `sh`, or `cn`.
4. Run `make` to build. Specify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent).

Ensure the repo path length does not exceed 255 characters. Long path names result in build errors.

## Installation

### Windows

Install WSL and a distro of your choice following
[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
We recommend either Debian or Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distributions under WSL.
Note: WSL1 does not currently support Ubuntu 20.04.

Next, clone the SM64 repo from within the Linux shell:
`git clone https://github.com/HackerN64/ultrasm64-2.git`

Then continue following the directions in the [Linux](#linux) installation section below.

### Linux

There are 3 steps to set up a working build.

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

The build system has the following package requirements:
 * binutils-mips
 * pkgconf
 * python3 >= 3.6

Dependency installation instructions for common Linux distros are provided below:

##### Debian / Ubuntu
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential git pkgconf python3
```

##### Arch Linux
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel python
```
Install the following AUR packages:
* [mips64-elf-binutils](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mips64-elf-binutils) (AUR)

##### Other Linux distributions

Most modern Linux distributions should have equivalent packages to the other two listed above.
You may have to use a different version of GNU binutils. Listed below are fully compatible binutils
distributions with support in the makefile, and examples of distros that offer them:

* `mips64-elf-` (Arch AUR)
* `mips-linux-gnu-` (Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros)
* `mips64-linux-gnu-` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora)

You may also use [Docker](#docker-installation) to handle installing an image with minimal dependencies.

#### Step 2: Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction

For each version (jp/us/eu/sh/cn) for which you want to build a ROM, put an existing ROM at
`./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.

##### Step 3: Build the ROM

Run `make` to build the ROM (defaults to `VERSION=us`).
Other examples:
```
make VERSION=jp -j4       # build (J) version instead with 4 jobs
make VERSION=eu COMPARE=0 # build (EU) version but do not compare ROM hashes
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.

The full list of configurable variables are listed below, with the default being the first listed:

* ``VERSION``: ``jp``, ``us``, ``eu``, ``sh``, ``cn``
* ``GRUCODE``: ``f3d_old``, ``f3d_new``, ``f3dex``, ``f3dex2``, ``f3dzex``
* ``COMPARE``: ``1`` (compare ROM hash), ``0`` (do not compare ROM hash)
* ``NON_MATCHING``: Use functionally equivalent C implementations for non-matchings. Also will avoid instances of undefined behavior.
* ``CROSS``: Cross-compiler tool prefix (Example: ``mips64-elf-``).

### macOS

With macOS, you may either use Homebrew or [Docker](#docker-installation).

#### Homebrew

#### Step 1: Install dependencies
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and the following dependencies:
```
brew update
brew install coreutils make pkg-config tehzz/n64-dev/mips64-elf-binutils
```

#### Step 2: Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction

For each version (jp/us/eu/sh/cn) for which you want to build a ROM, put an existing ROM at
`./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.

##### Step 3: Build the ROM

Use Homebrew's GNU make because the version included with macOS is too old.

```
gmake VERSION=jp -j4       # build (J) version instead with 4 jobs
```

### Docker Installation

#### Create Docker image

After installing and starting Docker, create the docker image. This only needs to be done once.
```
docker build -t sm64 .
```

#### Build

To build, mount the local filesystem into the Docker container and build the ROM with `docker run sm64 make`.

##### macOS example for (U):
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

##### Linux example for (U):
For a Linux host, Docker needs to be instructed which user should own the output files:
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 --user $UID:$GID sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.
